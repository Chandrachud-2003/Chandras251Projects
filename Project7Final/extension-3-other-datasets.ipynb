    "I have used the RBF network to classify other datasets. Specifically, I loaded the breast cancer dataset using the load_breast_cancer function from sklearn.datasets. The dataset was split into training and test sets using the train_test_split function from sklearn.model_selection. The RBF network was created with 10 hidden units and 2 output classes, and then trained on the training set using the train method from the RBF_Net class.\n",

The accuracy of the network was then calculated using the accuracy method from the RBF_Net class. The training accuracy was found to be 0.90 and the test accuracy was 0.94.\n",
